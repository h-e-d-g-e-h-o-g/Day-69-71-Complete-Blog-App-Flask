WSGI:- Web server gateway interface
WSGI is a web server that is created to run python applications.
A normal web server is unable to run python applications.
Its specialization is that, it standardises the language and protocols between flask application and host server.
Gunicorn is one of WSGI.
Now, we need to tell the hosting provider about our gunicorn, what our app is called and how to run our flask app.
We tell the hosting provider through config file called "procfile".
